# Vocdoni Token State

### This is WIP

The aim for this tool is to provide a GoLang library and a HTTP/API service that can be used to fetch an updated list of token holders for a Ethereum token.
The list of supported tokens is:

- ERC20
- ERC721
- ERC1155
- ERC777
- Nation3 (veNation)
- wANT

It must allow to get the holders list, amounts on a specific block.

The token holders list and the amounts are stored into a zkSnarks friendly Merkle Tree (currently Arbo).

### Examples

Start the token scan service, the API will listen at port 7788 HTTP.

```bash
go run ./cmd/tokenscan --url=wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws/v3/INFURA_TOKEN --port=7788
```

 Add a new contract (Aragon Network Token) and an initial block number to start the scan.

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:7788/api/addContract/0xa117000000f279D81A1D3cc75430fAA017FA5A2e/erc20/11000000
```

The service will start scaning the token transfers from the initial block provided.

List the existing added contracts.

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:7788/api/listContracts
```

Fetch the metadata of a contract.

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:7788/api/getContract/0xa117000000f279D81A1D3cc75430fAA017FA5A2e
```

The Balances can be fetched by calling `balances` method.

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:7788/api/balances/0xa117000000f279D81A1D3cc75430fAA017FA5A2e
```

A token can be queued for rescan (there might be some missing blocks if issues with web3 provider).

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:7788/api/rescan/0xa117000000f279D81A1D3cc75430fAA017FA5A2e
```

Get the last merkle root hash of the tree for a contract.

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:7788/api/root/0xa117000000f279D81A1D3cc75430fAA017FA5A2e
```

Export the last tree (containing all leafs) so it can be shared on the network for generating merkle proofs.

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:7788/api/export/0xa117000000f279D81A1D3cc75430fAA017FA5A2e
```
