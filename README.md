# census3

Census3 is an API service which facilitates the creation of Vocdoni censuses whose eligible voters are defined by token-holders of some cryptocurrency token(s). The service has a list of registered tokens whose holder addresses and balances it keeps updated in real time. 

The Census3 service then uses this token-holder information to create a merkle tree census (compatible with [Vocdoni](https://vocdoni.io/)) according to some given eligibility criteria. 

This code is written in golang and is meant to be used in conjunction with other Vocdoni tools, such as the [API](https://developer.vocdoni.io/vocdoni-api/vocdoni-api). 

The best place to learn about interacting with the Census3 Service is the [developer portal](https://developer.vocdoni.io/).

## Getting Started

You can run the Census3 service locally for testing or deploy it yourself.

#### Using the CLI

You can locally host your own Census3 service by first building this code:
```sh
go build -o census3 ./cmd/census3
```

Then you can run the binary with the following possible options:
```sh
./census3 --help
Usage of ./census3:
      --adminToken string          the admin UUID token for the API
      --connectKey string          connect group key for IPFS connect
      --dataDir string             data directory for persistent storage (default "~/.census3")
      --logLevel string            log level (debug, info, warn, error) (default "info")
      --port int                   HTTP port for the API (default 7788)
      --scannerCoolDown duration   the time to wait before next scanner iteration (default 2m0s)
      --initialTokens string       path of the initial tokens json file
      --web3Providers string       the list of URLs of available web3 providers
      --gitcoinEndpoint string     Gitcoin Passport API access token
      --gitcoinCooldown duration   Gitcoin Passport API cooldown (default 6h0m0s)
      --poapAPIEndpoint string     POAP API endpoint
      --poapAuthToken string       POAP API access token
```

Example:

```sh
./census3 --web3Providers https://goerli.rpcendpoint.io/,https://mainnet.rpcendpoint.io/ --logLevel debug

# or just:
# go run ./cmd/census3 --web3Providers https://goerli.rpcendpoint.io/,https://mainnet.rpcendpoint.io/ --logLevel debug
```

#### Using Docker

1. Create your config file using the [`.env` file](example.env) as a template and save it the root.
```sh
# Domain name for TLS
DOMAIN=your.own.domain.xyz
# A web3 endpoint provider
CENSUS3_WEB3PROVIDERS="https://rpc-endoint.example1.com,https://rpc-endoint.example2.com"
# Internal port for the service (80 and 443 are used by traefik)
CENSUS3_PORT=7788
# Log level (info, debug, warning, error)
CENSUS3_LOGLEVEL="debug"
# IPFS connect key for discovering nodes
# CONNECT_KEY=yourIPFSConnectKey
CENSUS3_CONNECTKEY="census3key"
# Internal data folder
CENSUS3_DATADIR="./.census3"
# Scanner cooldown duration
CENSUS3_SCANNERCOOLDOWN="20s"
# UUID admin token for protected endpoints
CENSUS3_ADMINTOKENS="UUID"
# POAP API configuration
CENSUS3_POAPAPIENDPOINT="poapAPIEndpoint"
CENSUS3_POAPAUTHTOKEN="yourPOAPAuthToken"
# Gitcoin API configuration
CENSUS3_GITCOINAPIENDPOINT="gitcoinAPIEndpoint"
CENSUS3_INITIALTOKENS="/app/initial_tokens.json"
```

2. Run the services with `docker compose`:
```sh
docker compose up -d
```

## Reference

The Census3 usage and API is documented at the [developer portal](https://developer.vocdoni.io/protocol/census/on-chain/census3#api-defintion). We recommend reading this documentation before trying to run your own examples.

## Examples

The following shows a basic example for creating a Census3 census using a locally-running instance:

0. Start the API service on `localhost:7788` with a web3 provider for `mainnet`
1. Register a new `erc20` token from `mainnet (chainId: 1)` by its contract address:

```sh
curl -X POST \
      --json '{"ID": "0xFE67A4450907459c3e1FFf623aA927dD4e28c67a", "type": "erc20", "chainID": 1}' \
      http://localhost:7788/api/tokens
```

1. Wait for the API service to complete the token synchronization. It could take up to 10-20 minutes, even more, based on the number of holders and transactions (for this reason, high-traffic tokens like ETH are infeasible). You can check the token sync status by fetching the token info:
```sh
curl -X GET \
      http://localhost:7788/api/tokens/0xFE67A4450907459c3e1FFf623aA927dD4e28c67a
```

1. When the token reaches `synced` status (`token.status.synced = true`), you can create a new census based on the default token strategy. This strategy is created during the token registration and just contains the holders of the token. To create the census with token holders, you need to know the `token.defaultStrategy` (from the token info endpoint):
```sh
curl -X POST \
        --json '{"strategyID": <strategyId>, "anonymous": true}" \
        http://localhost:7788/api/censuses
```
1. The previous request will return a `queueId` which identifies the census creation and publication processes on the API queue. Census publication will be completed in the background. We can check if the task is done and whether it raised an error or was successfully completed:
```sh
curl -X GET \
        http://localhost:7788/censuses/queue/<queueId>
```

You can also automatically run this example using the [`example.sh` file](./example.sh):
```sh
sh ./example.sh

-> creating token...
Ok
-> created, waiting 4m to token scan
-> getting token info...

## Disclaimer

The Census3 service is WIP. Please beware that it can be broken at any time if the release is `alpha` or `beta`. We encourage you to review this repository and the developer portal for any changes.
